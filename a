Hard-wrapping mimics the constraints of paper—fixed measures and arbitrary line breaks—in a medium that doesn’t need them. Once relied on, window size stops being a matter of personal or contextual importance and becomes a hidden formatting contract: change the window width, and the hard breaks no longer align with the display. In phones, adjustment is not even possible.

This is especially problematic with proportional fonts. Hard-wrapping tools must assume fixed-width characters because they cannot know the font’s rendered widths, and even if they could, switching to another proportional font—with different character widths—would break the formatting. The result is prose that is visually uneven and unstable, sensitive to any change in geometry or typography.

+ Hard-wrapped text interferes with copying and pasting. When you copy text from a browser and paste it into your editor, literal newlines often break sentences in awkward places. This makes the text harder to edit or reuse and forces reformatting to restore natural flow. In contrast, soft-wrapped text adapts automatically to the new environment, eliminating this extra work.

While creating a script to automatically reformat text on save—like gofmt for Go code—might help, it introduces new problems by requiring a prefix to avoid reformatting code and tables, typically four spaces or a tab. This conflicts with how people expect items and quotes to be indented for visual separation from surrounding prose, which improves readability and clarity. Indenting text in this way prevents proper wrapping, resulting in a disjointed experience where the script only partially solves the problem and introduces new complications. However, this isn’t to discredit the script approach entirely—such a script could also handle tasks like removing trailing whitespaces, and as a side effect, it would help maintain consistency across files.

Hard-wrapped text interferes with versioning. At a glance, hard-wrapped might seem better than soft-wrapped text for versioning, but the difference lies in reformatting. In soft-wrapped text, a paragraph is a single line, so changing a word shows up clearly in any decent diff tool as a highlight. In hard-wrapped text, however, changing a word at the start can force the rest of the lines to reformat, producing a multi-line diff that hides the actual semantic change and prevents Git from showing exactly what was altered.

Semantic line breaks, where lines are broken at logical or syntactic points rather than fixed widths—similar to programming—can help with versioning and tracking changes, but in practice they often make text harder to read and consume a lot of vertical space. While semantic line breaks do help in editing if you are using a keyboard-based editor, that advantage is negated when using a mouse-based one. Moreover, semantic breaks are also inherently personal: one person might use them sparingly, while a collaborator overuses them, turning flowing prose into something closer to haiku.

Some argue that hard-wrapped text is easier to read in a terminal, browser, or editor because it avoids the need to resize the window for a single task—reading soft-wrapped text. However, a new instance of the application can be opened if you don’t want to change the size of the current window. In browsers, tabs can easily be dragged out into a new window, allowing one to resize without affecting the main view. In fact, the window-focused approach that soft-wrapped text encourages can be seen as an advantage: it discourages keeping unnecessary windows open, something a tab-focused workflow encourages. That said, it doesn’t have to be an either-or situation, since a combination of tabs and windows can function effectively as workspaces. Ultimately, those who argue for the hard-wrapped approach forget why overlapping windows exist in the first place.



Despite these disadvantages, hard-wrapping still has some advantages. It supports hanging indents, which soft-wrapping mishandles by starting subsequent lines at the paragraph margin, and wide tables, which remain readable because increasing the column width doesn’t stretch the prose. However, for your own text, you can just keep short items and tables, negating these advantages—and hanging indents sometimes look inconsistent in proportional fonts.

While the issue with proportional fonts is correct, it is still better to have items than not.


There are universal correct line lengths. Most websites have chosen a fixed line length and no one seems to be complaining. 

there are bad line lengths (too long to read),
there are good-enough conventions (e.g. 72–80 columns),
consistency matters more than personalization in shared text.

Typography research consistently shows that extremely long lines harm readability. Hard-wrapping enforces an upper bound.




Hard-wrapping is often criticized for imposing fixed line lengths, but this misunderstands its purpose. Its goal is not to enforce a single perfect line length, but to prevent extremely long lines that reduce readability and strain the eyes. For example, wide tables remain readable because increasing the column width doesn’t stretch the prose.

The claim that hard-wrapping interferes with search is overstated. While it is true that literal newlines can break matches and that you’re unlikely to remember their exact positions, hard-wrapping makes multi-file results more precise by returning individual lines instead of entire paragraphs. This allows you to locate relevant content quickly without being forced to scroll through entire paragraphs. Modern tools may highlight matches within long paragraphs, but scanning a long block of text is still slower than scanning a list of short, clearly separated lines. While options like "grep -o" show only the exact match, that approach is often too extreme, removing useful context entirely. In this sense, hard-wrapped lines function like short file names in a directory listing: they provide just enough information to identify what you need without extra clutter.

Version control considerations further strengthen the case for hard-wrapping. Diffs of soft-wrapped paragraphs often display entire blocks of text as a single line, making it harder to quickly identify what actually changed. In terms of collaboration, hard-wrapping can make the initial barrier to entry slightly higher, but it also makes line-level commenting on platforms like GitHub much easier. With hard-wrapped text, you can select and comment on the exact line you want, whereas soft-wrapped paragraphs often require selecting the entire block and then clarifying which part your comment refers to.
