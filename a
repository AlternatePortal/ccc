Hard-wrapping is a nuisance for searching. Literal newlines break matches, whether in a single file using your favourite editor or across many with tools like grep. You’re never going to remember where those newlines were, so you can’t reliably include them in a search. Hard-wrapping once made multi-file results more precise by returning individual lines instead of entire paragraphs, allowing you to locate relevant content quickly. But today, colour highlights show the exact match, making that old advantage largely irrelevant. That said, when a search returns multiple matches, unwrapped text can still be inconvenient. You may end up scrolling through long paragraphs to find the right file, which can take more time than scanning a list of matching lines.

Hard-wrapped text interferes with copying and pasting. When you copy text from a browser and paste it into your editor, literal newlines often break sentences in awkward places. This makes the text harder to edit or reuse and forces regular reformatting to restore natural flow. In contrast, soft-wrapped text adapts automatically to the new environment, eliminating this extra work.
