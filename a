Hard-wrapping mimics the constraints of paper—fixed measures and arbitrary line breaks—in a medium that doesn’t need them. Once relied on, window size stops being a matter of personal or contextual importance and becomes a hidden formatting contract: change the window width, and the hard breaks no longer align with the display. Moreover, there's no universal correct line length, as everyone adjusts their view to what works best for them—except on narrow devices like phones, where adjustments aren’t even possible.

This is especially problematic with proportional fonts. Hard-wrapping tools must assume fixed-width characters because they cannot know the font’s rendered widths, and even if they could, switching to another proportional font—with different character widths—would break the formatting. The result is prose that is visually uneven and unstable, sensitive to any change in geometry or typography.

Hard-wrapping is a nuisance for searching. Literal newlines break matches, whether in a single file using your favourite editor or across many with tools like grep. You’re never going to remember where those newlines were, so you can’t reliably include them in a search. Hard-wrapping once made multi-file results more precise by returning individual lines instead of entire paragraphs, allowing you to locate relevant content quickly. But today, colour highlights show the exact match, making that old advantage largely irrelevant. That said, when a search returns multiple matches, unwrapped text can still be inconvenient. You may end up scrolling through long paragraphs to find the right file, which can take more time than scanning a list of matching lines.

Hard-wrapped text interferes with copying and pasting. When you copy text from a browser and paste it into your editor, literal newlines often break sentences in awkward places. This makes the text harder to edit or reuse and forces regular reformatting to restore natural flow. In contrast, soft-wrapped text adapts automatically to the new environment, eliminating this extra work.

While creating a script to automatically reformat text on save—like gofmt for Go code—might help, it introduces new problems by requiring a prefix to avoid reformatting code and tables, typically four spaces or a tab. This conflicts with how people expect items and quotes to be indented for visual separation from surrounding prose, which improves readability and clarity. Indenting text in this way prevents proper wrapping, resulting in a disjointed experience where the script only partially solves the problem and introduces new complications. However, this isn’t to discredit the script approach entirely—such a script could also handle tasks like removing trailing whitespaces, and as a side effect, it would help maintain consistency across files.

Hard-wrapped text interferes with versioning. At a glance, hard- and soft-wrapped text might seem similar for versioning, but the difference lies in reformatting. In soft-wrapped text, a paragraph is a single line, so changing a word shows up clearly in any decent diff tool as a highlight. In hard-wrapped text, however, changing a word at the start can force the rest of the lines to reformat, producing a multi-line diff that hides the actual semantic change and prevents Git from showing exactly what was altered. On the other hand, because each line is independent in hard-wrapped text, two people could edit different lines in the same paragraph without causing a merge conflict—something that wouldn’t happen if the paragraph were soft-wrapped as a single line.

Semantic line breaks, where lines are broken at logical or syntactic points rather than fixed widths—similar to programming—can help with versioning and tracking changes, but in practice they often make text harder to read and consume a lot of vertical space. While semantic line breaks do help in editing if you are using a keyboard-based editor, that advantage is negated when using a mouse-based one. Moreover, semantic breaks are also inherently personal: one person might use them sparingly, while a collaborator overuses them, turning flowing prose into something closer to haiku.

Some argue that hard-wrapped text is easier to read in a terminal, browser, or editor because it avoids the need to resize the window for a single task—reading soft-wrapped text. However, a new instance of the application can be opened if you don’t want to change the size of the current window. In browsers, tabs can easily be dragged out into a new window, allowing one to resize without affecting the main view. In fact, the window-focused approach that soft-wrapped text encourages can be seen as an advantage: it discourages keeping unnecessary windows open, something a tab-focused workflow encourages. That said, it doesn’t have to be an either-or situation, since a combination of tabs and windows can function effectively as workspaces. Ultimately, those who argue for the hard-wrapped approach forget why overlapping windows exist in the first place.

Despite these disadvantages, hard-wrapping still has some advantages. It supports hanging indents, which soft-wrapping mishandles by starting subsequent lines at the paragraph margin, and wide tables, which remain readable because increasing the column width doesn’t stretch the prose. However, for your own text, you can just keep short items and tables, negating these advantages—and hanging indents sometimes look inconsistent in proportional fonts.

In conclusion, soft-wrapping adapts to user preferences, improves readability, separates presentation from content, and solves many of the practical challenges that hard-wrapping imposes. It’s a more flexible, modern solution for writing and collaboration.
